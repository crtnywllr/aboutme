I am a lover of self knowledge and growth. I spend a lot of my time thinking about psychology, philosophy, economics, my experience of the world, and now coding! I like to cook, eat and exercise - current favorite is doing headstands. 
Helping people heal from their childhood trauma is the main focus of my work and of my own personal work. Beyond that, what's important to me is keeping my brain sharp, taking good care of my body, being a good partner to my S.O., and watching cute videos on Reddit to make me smile. 
I'm from the PNW and live there currently, but have also lived and worked in 7 different countries...so far!
Reading, cooking, sewing, journaling, Spider Solitaire, long walks, and brewing probiotic drinks.
I don't have one dream job...my dream life is one where I wear a couple different hats and have space for all the variety, i.e. working part time as a therapist, part time as a developer, all while living on a hobby farm.
I dig instrumental music. Vangelis never lets me down.
